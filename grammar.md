This is the simple grammar for the language. 
The lexer and parse in code are much more complicated but deal with complex error handling.

```
program -> [expr]

expr -> value
expr -> operator
expr -> callspec
expr -> assignment

value -> function
value -> int
value -> ident
value -> char
value -> string

operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
operator -> '-'
```
