This week I implemented the parser, 
and focused on having very good error handling and a good test framework.

The primary piece of good feedback I recieved was related to my errors, 
which I am very pleased with.
I also recieved good feedback relating to my test coverage, 
however it was suggested that I split these tests into files, 
and implement a few more error cases, which
are definitely things I will work towards before next week.

It was also suggeted that I use the Makefile to install library dependences,
however this is not something that I like the idea of, as it gets messy
when a user wants to install dependancies their own way, which is the usual
case anyway.
