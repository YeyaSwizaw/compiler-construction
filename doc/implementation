To implement the language stack, I have written a C library.

The library contains an implementation of a linked-list-based stack,
and contains functions for pushing values to the stack, and for attempting application.

For application, I was forced to make the implementation of functions take an array of arguments,
instead of individual arguments, because application requires popping arguments off the stack until 
there are enough to apply to a function, and this is not reasonably doable in C. Unfortunately, this
makes the language very inefficient, as every function call requires a malloc for the array, a free
for every item popped off the stack, and then a free on the call return to free the array.
